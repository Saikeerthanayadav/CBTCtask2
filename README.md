OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT:
Tt involve setting up the graphical interface for a Receipt Generator application using Python with tkinter. Here are the key functions performed by the code:-
- Creating the GUI Elements:
The code creates labels and entry fields for capturing customer details such as name, items purchased, quantity, and total amount.
Each label provides a description of the information expected in the corresponding entry field.
- Organizing Elements in the Interface:
The grid layout manager is used to organize the labels and entry fields in rows and columns within the GUI window.
This layout helps in structuring the interface in a user-friendly manner, making it easy for users to input the required information.
- Setting Up the Main Application Window:
The code initializes the main application window using tkinter and sets the title of the window to "Receipt Generator".
This step establishes the foundation for the graphical interface where users can interact with the application.
- Running the Main Event Loop:
The `root.mainloop()` function starts the main event loop of the tkinter application.
This function is essential for displaying the GUI elements and allowing users to interact with the interface by entering data into the entry fields.

By performing these functions, the code lays the groundwork for a Receipt Generator application interface where users can input customer details to generate receipts. Further development can involve adding functionality to calculate totals, generate receipts, and enhance the user experience.
